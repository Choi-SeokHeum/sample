How To Run The Demo project
---------------------------

Place the libguic.so file and the qmldir file after the build of 
the Component project into IVIS / Component in the path below $$ [QT_INSTALL_QML].

example) opt/qt5/qml/IVIS/Component

If you write 'message ($$ [QT_INSTALL_QML]') in your project's .pro file, 
you can check the absolute path of the corresponding directory through the log at build time.
